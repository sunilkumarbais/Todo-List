# Todo List

A simple and interactive **To-Do List Application** that helps users manage tasks efficiently. It includes features like adding, deleting, and persisting tasks using local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Add tasks with a name and a due date.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list with a single click.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they remain available even after refreshing the page.
- **Real-Time Rendering:** The UI updates dynamically with every action, reflecting the current state of tasks.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunilkumarbais/Todo-List.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

## File Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the application.
